***Understanding Command Line Basics 
####Exploring Your Linux Shell Options
The shell is used to enter commands and there are a variety of shells. 
-bash: bash is hte most common default shll for user accounts, and it's the one emphasized in this book. 
-sh: The Bourne shell upon which bash is based goes bythe name sh. It's not often used in Linux and the sh command is often a pointer to the bash shell or other shells.
-tcsh: This shell is based on the earlier C shell(csh), popular in some circles
-csh: The original C shell isnt used much on Linux
-ksh: The Korn shell(ksh) was designed to take the best features of the Bourne shell and the C shell and extend them. 
-zsh: The Z shell(zsh)adds more improvents from the Korn shell

There are two types of default shells. The defaults interactives shell is the shell program a user users to enter comamnds, run programs from the command line, run shell scripts, and so on. The other default shell tpe is a default system shell. The default system shell is used by the Linux system to run system shell scripts, typically at startup. 

The file bin/sh is a pointer to the systems default system shell.

####Starting a Shell
ONce you start a terminal or log into a virtual console terminal, the shell will provide you with a prompt for entering commands. Remember that the shell is a program providing you with an interface to the Linux system. 

A good first command to try, uname, will show you what operating system is being run

$ uname
Linux
$

That's not too interesting, you can find out more by tacking on the -a option to the command. 

$ uname -a
[output]
$

####Using Internal and External Commands
Internal commands are commands built into the Shell program. Thus they are also called built-in commands. Most shells offer a similar set of internal commands, but shell-to-shell differences do exist. 

Change the Working Directory: 
$ cd /var/ftp

A shortcut to your home directory
$cd ~

Display the working directory:
$pwd

Display a line of text:
The echo command displays the text you enter. This may seem pointless but is usefull for scripts.
$echo Hello
hello
$

Time an Operation:
The time command times how long subsequent commands take to execute. For instance, typing time pwd tells you how long the system take to execute. 

Three times are displayed, total execution time, user CPU time, and system CPU time. 

$time pwd
/home/ubuntu
real  0m0.000s
user  0m0.000s
sys   0m0.000s

Set Options:
The set command displays a wide variety of options relating to bash shell operation. 

Terminate the Shell:
The exit and logout commands both terminate the shell. The exit command terminates any shell, but the logout command terminates only login shells. 

Login shells are shell programs that are launched automatically when you initiate a text mode login as opposed ot those that run in xterm windows or other terminal emulators. 

Determining if a command is a built in command:
You can determine if a command is a built in command by using the type command.
$type pwd
pwd is a shell builtin
$
$type cd
cd is a shell builtin
